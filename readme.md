# SCSS-playing-cards
A deck of cards created in 100% CSS3. There are no images, so cards can scale to any size. Currently, just has the HTML/CSS for each card. Next step is to add the JS to shuffle and deal the cards. 


## TODO
- Figure out something for facecards
- Add the back of the cards, thinking red and white criss-cross stripes
- Add animations to shuffle, flip, rotate, and deal the cards
- Cards will animate from the deck to the middle of the table, flipping and turning as they move
- Rename the project, just recently found out about a physical deck of cards called "Helveticards"
